# [Backstage](https://backstage.io)

This is your newly scaffolded Backstage App, Good Luck!

To start the app, run:

```sh
make install
make run
```

Provide Github identity in http://localhost:3000/settings/auth-providers.

This setup installs backstage plugins. The OTEL demo should be visible in backstage by default -- you can explore provided components, API and docs. In each component, we provide a simple overview including security, dependabot and GH codespaces. More info is available in the tabs. Components documentation is hosted in https://github.com/jmichalak9/opentelemetry.io.
